IMPORTANT REMARKS
  - x=0 and x=L are NOT part of the solution vector when using reflective walls.
  - how to treat x=0 and x=L when using PBC?
     - (verify this by checking that eigenstate of periodic delta lattice doesn't evolve)

IMPORTANT THINGS TO SHOW:

  - When an eigenstate is used, only the phase changes
    - do this for reflective walls AND periodic boundary conditions

  - Stability:  show that sum(abs(psi)**2)) is constant over time
    - question asks to do this for plain box potential
